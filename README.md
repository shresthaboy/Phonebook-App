# Web App using React, Node.js, and JSON Server

## Project Overview
This project is a web application developed using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and JSON Server as a mock API. The application allows users to extract data, send it to the server using POST requests, and read data from the server using GET requests. We used the Axios library for HTTP requests to communicate with the backend.

## Features
